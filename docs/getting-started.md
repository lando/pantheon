# Getting Started

Before you get started with this recipe, we assume that you have:

1. [Installed Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html) and gotten familiar with [its basics](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/).
2. [Initialized](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/init.html) a [Landofile](https://docs.lando.dev/config/lando.html) for your codebase for use with this recipe.
3. Read about the various [services](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html), [tooling](https://docs.lando.dev/config/tooling.html), [events](https://docs.lando.dev/config/events.html) and [routing](https://docs.lando.dev/config/proxy.html) Lando offers.

However, because you are a developer and developers never ever [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM), you can also try out this recipe with a vanilla install of WordPress with the commands as follows:

```bash
# Go through interactive prompts to get your site from pantheon
lando init --source pantheon

# OR do it non-interactively
lando init \
  --source pantheon \
  --pantheon-auth "$PANTHEON_MACHINE_TOKEN" \
  --pantheon-site "$PANTHEON_SITE_NAME"

# Start it up
lando start

# Import your database and files
lando pull

# List information about this app.
lando info
```
