# Pantheon Lando Plugin

This is the _official_ [Lando](https://lando.dev) plugin for [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io). When installed it...

* Closely mimics Pantheon's [stack, versions](https://docs.pantheon.io/platform/) and [environment](https://docs.pantheon.io/read-environment-config/) locally
* Allows you to easily `pull` your Pantheon site down locally
* Allows you to easily `push` your changes back to Pantheon
* Installs `drush`, `terminus` and other power tools.

Of course, once a user is running their Pantheon project with Lando they can take advantage of [all the other awesome development features](https://docs.lando.dev) Lando provides.


## Basic Usage

Clone a project down from Pantheon.

```bash
# Make and go into an empty directory
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

# Go through interactive prompts to get your site from pantheon
lando init --source pantheon

# OR do it non-interactively
lando init \
  --source pantheon \
  --pantheon-auth "$PANTHEON_MACHINE_TOKEN" \
  --pantheon-site "$PANTHEON_SITE_NAME"

# Start it up
lando start

# Import your database and files
lando pull

# List information about this app.
lando info
```

Once your project is running you can access [relevant tooling commands](https://github.com/lando/pantheon/blob/main/docs/usage.md#application-tooling).
