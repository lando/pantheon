# Overview

[Pantheon](https://pantheon.io) is a web development hosting platform for open-source Drupal and WordPress websites. It is an app-specific PaaS provider, sold on a monthly subscription basis, with several support tiers available.

Lando provides a snazzy integration that:

* Closely mimics Pantheon's [stack, versions](https://pantheon.io/docs/platform/) and [environment](https://pantheon.io/docs/read-environment-config/) locally
* Allows you to easily `pull` your Pantheon site down locally
* Allows you to easily `push` your changes back to Pantheon
* Installs `drush`, `terminus` and other power tools.

However, in order to profit, **you must** have an account and a site on Pantheon to be able to use this recipe. If you don't, you can sign up [here](https://pantheon.io/register).

You should also check out Pantheon's [local dev](https://pantheon.io/docs/local-development/) docs.
